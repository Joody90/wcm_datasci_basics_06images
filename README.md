Unit Tests with Data Extracted From Microscopy Slices
---

For the following reasons...
    1. Keep things simple for beginner coders, no image processing + segmentation to extract cells. 
    2. Not disclose anything sensitive scientific findings from Dr. Huse's lab.

We will be working directly with `.csv` files instead of entire image stacks. The data in `.csv` files are fluorescence levels extracted by drawing a line of interest on top of T-cells secreting a signal of interest.
